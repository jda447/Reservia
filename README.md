:computer: **Project 1 - HTML & CSS**

:airplane: **Reservia**

First OpenClassrooms assignment. A prototype mockup was provided for a holiday booking site based on the principles of Material Design. I had to create this prototype by embedding the mockup in HTML and CSS. A 30 minute project presentation, discussion and debrief was required to pass.
